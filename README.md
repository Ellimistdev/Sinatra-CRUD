## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/endotnick/Sinatra-CRUD.git
$ bundle install
```

Migrate and Seed dev DB:

```bash
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
```

Sessions are enabled through Sinatra, so you'll need to either set an environment variable `SESSION_SECRET` on your system, or add it to a `.env` file at the root of the project. The [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem is included in development and should automatically pick up your `.env` file.

## Development

After installation, run 

```bash
$ rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=test
```
 to migrate the testing db,
 
```bash
$ rspec
```
to run the tests, and


```bash
$ shotgun
```
to launch the dev server.   
The app should be running on `localhost:9393` by default
